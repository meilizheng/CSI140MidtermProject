            <p>Ratings represent risk relative to the contiguous United States. 100 is the highest risk for the hazard and 1 is the lowest for the U.S., but does not indicate no risk. Flood and fire are rated based on the buildings in Mountain View exposed to these hazards. See hazard sections below and check your address for details.</p>

                    Climate change is increasing inland and coastal flooding risk due to sea level rise and increasing chances of extreme precipitation. See more information on flooding risk.</p>

                    <h2>The recent average water stress in Mountain View is significant and projected to increase through 2050.</h2>
                    <p>The Coyote watershed, which contains Mountain View, CA, has experienced 658 weeks (58% of weeks) since 2000 with some of its area in drought of any level, and 180 weeks (16% of weeks) since 2000 with some of its area in Extreme or Exceptional drought. Source: National Drought Monitor.
                        Climate change is increasing the risk of drought. Water stress (the ratio of water demand to supply) depends on how water utilities source water and their plans to adapt to climate change. Property owners can also take steps to reduce their risks from drought.</p>

Climate change increases risks from wildfire by creating hotter, drier conditions for fires to spread.
